## Known Issues
I do my best to test the website before releasing it, however, some issues might not be detected until released to production.

As of 3/12/2025, I've identified the following issues:
- `typewriter-effect` adds extra width which disrupts some contents in smaller screens during the duration of the effect.

I can't provide a specific date to fix these issues, but I am looking ways to improve my website **bi-weekly**, which includes fixes. 

Additionally, I know that some images look distorted and it's mainly because I am either streaching or shrinking the picture below or beyond it's parameters. It is not a high-priority task, but I am still looking for solutions.
